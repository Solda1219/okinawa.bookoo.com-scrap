You may be surprised by the amount of goods I put on sale... During my previous life, until a couple of years ago, I used to sell at flea markets. Getting older, to carry heavy boxes up-and-down slippery staircases at 5 a.m. is not for me anymore. So... here I am. I hope to be able to get rid of the whole circus I accumulated before the end of this life.I am also an addicted vinyl records collector, so I sell music to pay my expensive vice...THANK YOU very much and ciao!"

You may be surprised by the amount of goods I put on sale... During my previous life, until a couple of years ago, I used to sell at flea markets. Getting older, to carry heavy boxes up-and-down slippery staircases at 5 a.m. is not for me anymore. So... here I am. I hope to be able to get rid of the whole circus I accumulated before the end of this life.I am also an addicted vinyl records collector, so I sell music to pay my expensive vice...THANK YOU very much and ciao!"

        "description": "This tsuba came off of a katana long sword  by Genzaemon  Noshu ju Nobukuni, it still has remenants of the gold zogan inlay in the design of  \"Cho Cho\" Butterflies, a popular Samurai symbol and motif for that of life being fleeting and like a dream, ephemeral as the proverbial butterfly.  This tsuba sword guard is a wonderful example of the pierced open iron work that is of the Kamakura era style as it is thinner but was most likely made or  crafted during the Edo period.   Samurai sword guards are known as Tsuba. It originally came off of a tachi that was made in 1414 AD by Genzaemon noshu ju Nobukuni.    It comes in its own custom made kiri wood box and please contact me if you are interested in acquiring this unique iron tsuba sword guard .  Cheers, John",

        "description": "This amazing one of a kind yari / spear  is massive and in excellent condition.  It has a   Triangular shape with three sharp edges besides its massive spear tip,  with a weight over one kilogram,   27 cm in length ( almost one foot long) and 5 cm  width and 3 cm kasane thickness.  It is mounted in a  solid wooden shirasya (sleeping scabbard)  pole pictured  with wooden spear head cover as well with a  total length of 80 cm.   You have to  see and hold this \"behemoth\"  of a  Japanese spear to appreciate its heft, sharpness, and sheer deadly elegance.   It does have  a current valid Torokshou registration license and was made in the traditional way samurai swords and pole arms like yari, naginata, and ken were made. I acquired this item in the  Hakata Bay area of mainland Japan.  However its previous owner seemed to think it most modern use was for hunting bears or other large mammals as he acquired it in Hokkaido and its owner before him told some amazing tales of its use and origin in the northern most area of Japan known for having the large brown bears related to Grizzly bears.  A fascinating piece of history, no less formidable on the battle field than if used to hunt for sustenance.  Reminds me of the legendary monk Benke wielding his massive pole arm on that famous bridge in Japanese history and folk lore.  Please see the \"quarter \" pictured to give you some reference and scale for this massive blade.  It has an elegant and exquisite hamon tempering pattern  you can appreciate in the pictures provided..   Let me know if you are interested in viewing or acquiring this unique Yari / Spear.  Cheers , John",

        "description": "This genuinely made Nihonto Samurai sword was made during the warring Muromachi Era around 1466 A.D. and is suriaged or cut shortened but still retains the meibun signature of the excellent sword smith Fujiwara Norimitsu that made this amazing blade. The hamon tempering pattern is a midare gunome with wonderful hataraki activity known as Utsuri that appears as a cloudy mist in the hamon tempering pattern.  Its custom made koshirae and  kodogu mountings are of high quality with golden bell crickets menuki  handle ornaments and also gold plated  Kogai with cloisonne' and a kozuka kogatana  utility knife of a golden praying mantis motif \"mushi\"meaning insects. The fuchi kashira is modern of black metal shakudo and is of a \"nami\" wave pattern motif.  The tsuba sword guard is of a samurai kamon and not the one pictured but with a unique silver gray textured pattern, there  is only one mekugi ana mounting hole and the  hatawari length is  56.0 cm for this wakizashi.   Let me know if you want to view this amazing Nihonto in person. If you are new to Nihonto, traditionally made Japanese blades, I am happy to explain the care and maintenance for this wakizashi short sword. I can also provide you a free \"starter and maintenance kit\". This sword can be delivered to Kadena, Foster, and Courtney Bases or other areas upon request.

        "description": "This  O-wakizashi short sword is in new polish without any kizu or flaws  and is from the middle of the Muromachi Era and is a longer length wakizashi.  My friend and  7th generation \r \"togishi\"  sword polisher , Mr. Yoshisada Abe san of  Morioka, Japan referred to this blade as a \"treasure\" of the Nanbu Clan Samurai.   This  sword is attributed to the sword smith Kanesaki from the Mino area of Japan which was known as \"Seki \" and was heavily involved in the production of  samurai swords during this warring Muromachi Era between 1336-1573 A.D. and  even through WWII as evidenced by the Seki Arsenal.  Its origins of its making  dates back to around 500 years ago as it is of the Nanbu Clan of Samurai. This wakizashi is a wonderful example of the \"Kyo go-kaji\" also known as the \"Five Excellent smiths of Kyoto\" dating back all the way to the Mishina School of Swordsmiths who lived in Seki and Mino Provinces before branching out to Kyoto. Sword length is  54.3 cm , with Bo-hi groove down both sides of the blade, and a  sori /curvature of 1.3 cm, and one (1) Mekugi Ana/  rivet hole for mounting in the tang which is  \"Ubu\" meaning unaltered and in its original condition. The gold habaki sword collar is of an elegant design.  The saya has a slot for a kozuka/kogatana side utility knife.   The license registration  number is # 1013 from , Iwate Prefecture in Morioka, Japan (one of the very earliest registered blades based on  this low number).   The hamon pattern  is highly sought after  and is an  aesthetically pleasing togari gunome hamon tempering pattern resembling a stand of three cedar trees known as \"san-bon-sugi\" .  The jihada steel surface grain pattern is a mixture of masame  (Wood) and Asaygui ( Burl).  This treasure blade comes with a custom made sleeping scabbard known as a  shirasaya made from white magnolia  wood known for its properties of not retaining moisture. \rThe unique and elegant  saya koshirae is from the Edo period and is of a \" Pine needle in Brown Lacquer design.\"  The  Menuki handle ornaments are slightly older than the Edo period with the  Fuchi/ Kashira having been made by reknowned kodogu metal worker \"Syouzui Hamano\" who signed his work on this  handle pommel cap and tsuka sword collar.   It  is made of an alloy of copper and gold (shakudo) . The black silk tsuka maki handle wrap complements the  dark shakudo metal  handle ornament  menuki of  the  \"Carp\"  that is celebrated in the custom of a  standing Carp streamer when a son was born a long time ago , people believed the Carp will be able to change into a flying dragon if he never gives up which is  near the meaning of Boys' Day to be ambitious . The Fuchi / Kashira   illustrates a finely detailed pair of wild goose that are flying under the full moon light , with the female goose being  protected by the  male goose's wing . The kodogu maker of this Fuchi- Kashira set  was known by the name  Syouzui Hamano, who  a  very famous metal kodogu worker from the middle of the Edo period. Upon first examination the one wild goose appears to be  sleeping by the grassy shore ,  but  NO!     Rather  the goose's  eye is opening as it  keeps a vigilant watch out known as \" Zanshin\" or \"Awareness of one's surroundings\".  The iron Tsuba sword guard is also from the , Edo period  and is an open work of big waves (Nami) . The overall interpretation in studying this magnificent  unaltered blade and its amazingly preserved Edo period koshirae saya mounts and fittings is that  I think the previous sword owner had been teaching others  how to live the ideals of being a   Samurai , and pass on  this  \"Budo\"  spirit to the next generation.  For the serious sword collector it is the complete package.    Please contact me if you are interested in viewing or acquiring this Muromachi Era Wakizashi in Edo period  Koshirae saya and kodogu mounting and  fittings. You could be the new  future custodian for this amazing piece of Japanese history.\rIf you are new to Nihonto, traditionally made Japanese blades, I am happy to explain the care and maintenance for this wakizashi short sword. I can also provide you a free \"starter and maintenance kit\". This sword can be delivered  and shown to Kadena AB,  Foster, and Courtney Bases or other areas upon request.

Getting older, to carry heavy boxes up-and-down slippery staircases at 5 a.m. is not for me anymore. So... here I am. I hope to be able to get rid of the whole circus I accumulated before the end of this life.I am also an addicted vinyl records collector, so I sell music to pay my expensive vice...THANK YOU very much and ciao!"

To adjust different speed settings when working or sleeping, you can feel comfortable always. Worth mention, this air-cooling fan is taller so that more air can run up and down, which means the wind stronger. Not enough? The left-right swing fan can evenly spread cool air to wider space, perfect for being used at home, office or dorm.\r The portable air-cooling machine adopts 2 modes: standard wind and cold wind. You can put the ice crystal box into the water tank then the ice crystal refrigeration can make the room a bit cooler. What’s more, the large-capacity water tank can spray much more fresh air and effectively increase air humidity as well. Therefore, it can be used as a normal fan, personal air cooler and humidifier.",

Getting older, to carry heavy boxes up-and-down slippery staircases at 5 a.m. is not for me anymore. So... here I am. I hope to be able to get rid of the whole circus I accumulated before the end of this life.I am also an addicted vinyl records collector, so I sell music to pay my expensive vice...THANK YOU very much and ciao!"

You may be surprised by the amount of goods I put on sale... During my previous life, until a couple of years ago, I used to sell at flea markets. Getting older, to carry heavy boxes up-and-down slippery staircases at 5 a.m. is not for me anymore. So... here I am. I hope to be able to get rid of the whole circus I accumulated before the end of this life.I am also an addicted vinyl records collector, so I sell music to pay my expensive vice...THANK YOU very much and ciao!"

Getting older, to carry heavy boxes up-and-down slippery staircases at 5 a.m. is not for me anymore. So... here I am. I hope to be able to get rid of the whole circus I accumulated before the end of this life.I am also an addicted vinyl records collector, so I sell music to pay my expensive vice...THANK YOU very much and ciao!"

I hope to be able to get rid of the whole circus I accumulated before the end of this life.I am also an addicted vinyl records collector, so I sell music to pay my expensive vice...THANK YOU very much and ciao!"

I hope to be able to get rid of the whole circus I accumulated before the end of this life.I am also an addicted vinyl records collector, so I sell music to pay my expensive vice...THANK YOU very much and ciao!"

This is where back-office support comes to the rescue. Not only can it help you get everything organized, it can also save you a lot of money along the way. Data Entry and Processing\rManually inputting data into the system is a very time consuming and tedious task. Hiring somebody in your local market for such tasks would not make sense from a cost perspective. we can take care of these tasks thus saving you money and freeing up a lot of time that could be better spent or critical business activities. If you have multiple items in your backlog, they all need to be adjusted and prioritized based on your requirements. Not only will this keep you organized, but have a positive effect on other business processes.

This is recently upgraded and frame was re welded and inspected by Honda Japan as part of recall initiated by California Trikes. New ECU PGM Unit . New Spark plugs, New Air Filter and of course engine oil has just been changed together with the oil filter.  This is a very safe Trike. It has JCI with almost 2 years left. Has iPod audio system with subwoofer. Almost all chrome parts are new. New brake pads, brake boots. Ready to ride. Just replaced new front tire 2 days ago. It looks better in person than the photo. I made all of these to be ready  for my son. I guess the money will buy a Van that he wants. Thank you for watching. Serious inquiries only please",

The exact production year is unknown (MF-08 model was produced from 2004-2007). It does not require a JCI inspection since it is 250cc. It has a current annual base safety inspection required for the military registration (expires Feb 2023). The annual road tax is ¥1,000 and annual base safety inspection is $15. \r The electronically controlled Honda S Matic transmission allows the rider to select between CVT mode, automatic mode, and 6-speed manual mode. It is equipped with the Honda Smart Key Card system and has two lockable compartments. The bike has plenty of storage space, including a lighted compartment below the seat that fits two full-face helmets. In addition, the seat is large enough for two adults to sit comfortably for long periods of time. The 250cc engine has great fuel economy and enough power to easily cruise the expressway with a passenger and cargo.   \r Recent maintenance and upgrades:\rReplaced cylinder head cover gasket, engine oil, air filter, and spark plug (2022)\rNew mirrors (2022)\rReplaced final drive oil and coolant (2021)\rNew front and rear Bridgestone tires (2021)\rNew battery (2021)\r Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to see more pictures.

        "about_owner": "I joined Bookoo 10 years ago. I'm an unlimited member and have listed a lot of items over that time.       Items I sell are in great or near new condition and I always strive to give the best description possible.  If I miss anything in the description feel free to ask questions.  I try to answer all messages as they come across.         I offer my items on the first come first receive basis.  With that in mind my biggest pet peeve is when people inquire about items or tell me that they want to purchase an item and then I don't hear from them again.  If you are no longer interested let me know so that I can let others interested purchase the item.  Courtesy is golden.         I live by Courtney but travel all over the island throughout the week and I can arrange a meeting if you want, otherwise pick up is at Courtney.         Thank you for looking at my items and I appreciate your interest."

This is an amazing island car as it handles like it's on railroad tracks. I really hate to have to sell this but it isn't old enough to ship back to the states. This has to be my favorite car of all time. It has a stereo head unit with Bluetooth, TV, GPS, and Blu-Ray Player (Trust me, don't watch a movie when driving, I don't know how the Japanese do it). The unit is in Japanese of course but the Bluetooth will pick up streaming service in English. It has keyless entry and keyless ignition (the key is in the fob if needed).
